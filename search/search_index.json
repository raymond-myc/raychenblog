We can train a discriminator network \\(D(e_t)\\)to try to predict \\(a_{t-1}\\) from \\(e_t\\), and encourage the encoder to raise the loss of \\(D\\). This process is expected to remove information about \\(a_{t-1}\\) from \\(e_t\\). </p> <p>However, as the ultimate goal is to predict \\(a_t\\), and \\(a_{t-1}\\) may actually contain useful information that can help with the \\(a_t\\) prediction task. To avoid falsely eliminating the information related to this task, the authors proposed to also input the prediction \\(a_t\\) into the \\(D\\) network. This technique can be viewed as adding a \"shortcut\" to \\(D\\). If \\(D\\) would like to use \\(a_t\\)-related information to help identifying \\(a_{t-1}\\), it would directly use \\(a_t\\) rather than trying to recover this information from \\(e_t\\). The design choice remove the incentive/pressure for \\(E\\) to eliminate \\(a_t\\)-related information during the encoding process.</p> Network design. <p>Another trick is called the Information Bottleneck (IB). The key idea is to let \\(E\\) output encodings as Gaussian distribution and force its KL-div with unit Gaussian to approach zero. This design choice is somewhat empirical. The expectation for IB is to remove nuisance information not essential for the \\(a_t\\) prediction task.</p> <p>After applying the adversarial and IB trick, the following Figure shows that those tricks indeed help with the copycat problem (lower past action predictability) and resulted in higher performance.</p> Adversarial training and information bottleneck improve the situation.","tags":["paper","imitation learning"]},{"location":"Paper%20Reading%20001%20-%20Fighting%20Copycat%20Agents%20in%20Behavioral%20Cloning%20from%20Observation%20Histories/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>This paper discussed the copycat problem in the context of imitation learning.
